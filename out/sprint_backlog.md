# Sprint Backlog for Counting Program

## User Story 1: As the customer, I need a program that will count to 100 by 5s so that I can learn and practice counting in multiple of five.
### Acceptance Criteria:
- The program should start at zero.
- Each number displayed is incremented by 5.
- The program stops when it reaches or exceeds 100.
- The output format is "Number: [number]".
- Error handling for invalid inputs is included.

### Tasks:
1. Write a function to generate the sequence of numbers from zero up to and including 100, incrementing by 5 each time (Developer).
2. Implement a loop structure that calls this function and prints out "Number: [number]" for every number in the sequence (Developer).
3. Add error handling code to ensure the program can handle invalid inputs (Tester).
4. Write unit tests for each functionality of the program (Tester).

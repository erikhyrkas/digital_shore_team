# Status Report for Counting Program

The Digital Shore Team has made significant progress on the customer's request to create a program that counts by 5s up to 100. The following is an update on our current status:

## Sprint Backlog
- User Story 1: As the customer, I need a program that will count to 100 by 5s so that I can learn and practice counting in multiples of five.
    - Acceptance Criteria: The program must be able to count from 0 to 100, incrementing by 5 each time and display the results on screen.

## Progress
- We have completed the development of the required functionality and written tests to verify that it meets the customer's requirements.
- All acceptance criteria for User Story 1 have been met.

## Next Steps
- Review test results with Product Owner and prepare for deployment.
